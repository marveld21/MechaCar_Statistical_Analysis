## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression](link)
- Vehicle length and ground clearance have a non-random amount of variance to the model
- The P value for the model is 5.35e-11 (very close to 0) meaning that it is unlikely to be by chance and that the slope of our model is not 0.
- The model does a good job of predicting mpg of the prototypes, The model has an rÂ² value of 0.7149 which indicates 71% of mpg predictions can be determined by the model.
